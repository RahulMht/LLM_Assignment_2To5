## 📑 Project Overview
A compact repository demonstrating the impact of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare through two core artifacts:

1. **presentation_slides.pdf** – 12-slide, 16:9 ratio deck summarising market growth, use-cases and challenges.
2. **train-transformer-news-classification.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook that trains a transformer model for news-topic classification and underpins several statistics cited in the slides.

## 🗂 Repository Contents
| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `presentation_slides.pdf` | Final slide deck ready for PDF/PPT submission (no interactive elements). |
| `train-transformer-news-classification.ipynb` | End-to-end notebook: data prep, model training, evaluation, and visualisations. |
| `README.md` | This document.

> There is **no** `data/` directory; the notebook automatically downloads required datasets when first run.

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-healthcare-assignment.git
cd ai-healthcare-assignment

# Launch notebook
jupyter lab train-transformer-news-classification.ipynb
```
The notebook will prompt to install any missing packages (e.g., `transformers`, `datasets`).

## 📊 Slide Deck
Open `presentation_slides.pdf` directly in any PDF viewer or import into PowerPoint/Google Slides. The file already contains 16:9 pages and is ready for submission. Your name appears on the title slide.
