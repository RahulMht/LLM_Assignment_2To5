{"text": "Search programs...\nView all programsKathmandu University (KU) is an autonomous, not-for-profit, self-funding public institution established by an Act of Parliament in December 1991. It is an institution of higher learning dedicated to maintaining the standard of academic excellence in various classical and professional disciplines. The mission statement of the University is “to provide quality education for leadership”. The vision is “to become a world-class university devoted to bringing knowledge and technology to the service of mankind”. The University aspires to serve the nation by fulfilling the needs of the society through the motto of taking knowledge and skills “from the campus to the community.”\nThe University’s broadly perceived signature features include autonomous administration, financial self-sustenance, regular maintenance of the academic calendar, sustained trust of the international academic community, optimum contact between faculties and students and student-friendly environment, among others. Similarly, the University’s graduates are widely known for attributes such as substantive exposure to the industry and the community, research competence, technological literacy, moderate to high-level communicative competence, teamwork and leadership spirit and global compatibility.\nThe Senate is the apex body of the University. It comprises University authorities, dignified educationists, government secretaries, donors, mayors of local municipalities, teacher representatives, student representative, and representatives from affiliated institutions and industries. The Prime Minister, who is the Chancellor of the University, chairs the Senate. The Minister of Education is the Pro-Chancellor. The Executive Council and Academic Council develop internal policies and programs to run the University. The University’s Board of Trustees, which comprises renowned personalities including the founding fathers, is entrusted with the responsibilities of advising long-term plans and generating and managing of resources.\nThe University operates through seven Schools: (i) School of Arts, (ii) School of Education, (iii) School of Engineering, (iv) School of Law, (v) School of Management, (vi) School of Medical Sciences and (vii) School of Science. At present, the University offers more than 200 long-term and short-term academic programs and courses from intermediate to Ph.D. levels. As of June 2023, the University has produced 41,275 graduates.\nStudent fees cover 60% in KU’s financial management. The same percentage of student fees goes into salary and allowances. Other sources cover 40%, whereas the government support is 10%. A total of about 10% of the students studying in the University at various levels receive scholarships apart from educational loan facilities and other sponsoring schemes from different organizations.\nKU runs academic programs most of which are credited for being introduced for the first time in the country. Business Administration, Pharmacy, Environmental Science, Biotechnology, Human Biology, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Geomatics Engineering, Development Studies, Social Work, Technical Education, Media Studies, Civil Engineering with Specialization in Hydropower, Landscape Management and Heritage studies, Doctor of Medicine (DM) in Gastroenterology, DM in Neurology and MS by Research in Glaciology count among the pioneering programs in Nepal.\nThe University marked the year 2016 as its Silver Jubilee Year. On the occasion of the Silver Jubilee celebrations, Prof. Dr. Ram Kantha Makaju Shrestha, the then Vice-Chancellor, brought forward a vision document, Silver Jubilee Initiatives – Vision 2030, which pledges thrust for quality, innovation, equity, identity, impact and global engagement. These initiatives, founded on the University’s key achievements for 25 years in quality education, will remain instrumental towards achieving the status of a world-class university.", "comments": ""}
{"text": "Search programs...\nView all programsDear students and guardians,\nSince its inception as a public institution by an Act of Parliament, Kathmandu University has set the standard for quality higher education in Nepal, and its brand value is recognised globally. Having introduced futuristic pedagogies in engineering, medicine, science, management, humanities, education and law, KU is now poised to embrace the state-of-the-art technological, environmental and contemporary humanistic disciplines in its teaching-learning paradigms.\nThis transformation is now a global imperative, as the era of higher education, hitherto skewed towards loading young brains with information, knowledge and skills through teaching in classrooms, labs, and workshops, is nearing its end. For instance, adopting AI-enabled human-machine interfaces in teaching and learning has propelled a radical reorientation of wisdom over knowledge, future employability over current skills, and an undiminished trust in natural intelligence.\nIn this context, I call on you to collaborate in our new journey towards a smart, resilient and sustainable university. To this end, KU has started updating its curricula to be in tune with the changing global contexts, digitalising its academic services, and expanding its presence in all provinces of Nepal. Similarly, KU is undergoing a massive transformation in its academic governance and transparency by shortening the processes and reducing the paperwork while consolidating a system of accountability. In addition, through a meticulous reallocation of resources, KU is on its way to becoming a ‘green’ university in every sense of the term.\nKU aims to prepare its students to enter the competitive world of skills and jobs and, at the same time, continue to inculcate in them the zeal for social service, national development and respect for humanism. As the fourth Vice-Chancellor of KU, I invite you to join us in this mission of serving the future of humanity. Together, we will realise the dream of making KU a home-grown university with a global outlook and impact in academics, research and entrepreneurship.\nProf. Dr. Achyut Wagle\nVice-Chancellor", "comments": ""}

{"text": "Search programs...\nView all programsThe Himalaya Centre for Asian Studies (HiCAS) was established on the 27th of December, 2019 by the 591st Executive Council (EC) meeting of Kathmandu University (KU). In the initial days and months after its establishment, when it was under the School of Arts, the Centre became virtually inactive due to the sudden advent of Covid-19 virus and the impact it had on the whole University. Because of the lockdowns, travel restrictions and safety concerns, the initial months of the establishment were spent mostly discussing future plans and building networks. However, once the University came into normalization, HiCAS was turned into a Central Research Centre after the 1st amendment of its directive in 2023. The amended directive clearly outlines the aims, goals, structure and planned activities of HiCAS.\nThe founding members of HiCAS Professor Dr. Sagar Raj Sharma (Kathmandu University), Professor Dr Diwakar Acharya (Oxford University, UK), and Mr Mukunda Upadhyay (Nepal). Professor Sharma is also the Founding Director of the Centre.

{"text": "Search programs...\nView all programs\nI completed M Ed (1997) from TU and Postgraduate Diploma (2002), MSc (2003), and Ph.D. in Mathematics Education (2009) from Curtin University.\nMy service at KU started in 1998 initially as Lecturer, Assistant Professor in 2005, Associate Professor in 2012, and Professor in 2018.\nAdministratively I have served as the Coordinator of Research and Publication, Coordinator of Master Programs, and Associate Dean.\nI have worked as a Senate Member (Teacher Representative) for about three years.\nCurrently, I am the Dean of the School of Education.\nMy PhD research was about envisioning mathematics education as a meaningful and transformative learning enterprise that addresses students' diverse learning needs and helps students become critical, creative, and engaging learners. After the doctoral study, I identified a number of ways to translate such a vision into pedagogical actions, such as a) by contextualising educational processes according to students’ lifeworlds, b) by ensuring full participation of learners in all possible levels of pedagogical activities, c) by providing learners with opportunities to reflect critically on their learning journey and the nature of knowledge that they produce. My recent research has focused on constructing a transformative STEAM curriculum vision to facilitate teachers developing context-based and authentic pedagogies that help students gain access to much-needed knowledge and skills required for critical, active, and socially responsible citizenship.\nMy personal and professional philosophy stemming from my research and pedagogical practice has been shaped by a strong interest in social justice, equity, and cultural and environmental sustainability. As a teacher and researcher, I respect my students and research participants as ends-in-themselves (as opposed to means to other ends), acknowledging the importance of mutual respect in maintaining harmonious and productive relationships. I also believe in the notion, and act accordingly, that self-preservation is only possible through openness, truthfulness, and self-renewal. Social justice, reasonableness, the welfare of others, and sustainability are orienting principles that facilitate my decision-making process as a responsible citizen of the planet.\nKey Publications\nPandey, C., Luitel, B.C., Gurung, L.

{"text": "Central Library\nIntroduction\nLibrary plays crucial role in academic institution. It is the heart of the institution and indicator of its quality and standard. Keeping this in mind, KU, since its inception in 1991, set a priority for the development of good library systems in the university.\nThe Kathmandu University Central Library (KUCL) is centrally located in the university central premises and can be reached within three to five minutes from all departments and hostels. The library is housed in a three-story building with a space of about 2290 square meter. The KUCL has majority of books and journals specially related with School of Science and School of Engineering. It monitors services of all libraries of the university. Schools located in Kathmandu valley and Dhulikhel, have their own libraries to cater the information needs of the students and faculties.\nOther KU Libraries\n- Management Library, Balkumari (Lalitpur)\n- Arts and Education Library, Hattiban (Lalitpur)\n- Medical Sciences (KUMS) Library (Basic Sciences: Chaukot (Panauti) and Clinical Sciences: Dhulikhel Hospital)\n- KU Panchkhal Library (for Agriculture and AI), Panchkhal (Kavrepalanchowk).\n- Yogic Science Library, Chaukot (Panauti)\n- KUHS Library, Chaukot (Panauti)\nObjectives\n- To provide information for the fulfillment of the objectives of the university.\n- To provide information for teaching, research and management of the university.\n- To provide learning materials both in conventional and e-resources for study and research.\n- To adopt ICTs in housekeeping operations of the library.\n- To manage important documents in Archive mode\n- To be a full-fledged modern library (e-Library, Digital Library) and connect to all schools, extended & affiliated colleges.\nResource sharing between KU Central library systems to all schools, extended & affiliated colleges\nCollection of Information\nThe main focus is on professional areas like:\n- Sciences\n- Engineering\n- Management\n- Teacher-Education\n- Medical Sciences\n- Arts\n- Law\nKU Central Library has:\n- 60,000 Plus - Volumes of books\n- 2500 - CD-ROMs\n- 200 - Videocassettes\n- 125 - Journal titles and newsletters\n- 20 - Newspapers and Magazines\n- 75 - Audio cassettes\nInfrastructure:\nPeriodical section, technical processing section, Reference section, Stack-cum-reading room, Circulation section, Offices for librarian and assistant librarian, Store are all well designed. They are all equipped with necessary library furniture and equipment’s designed by the experts.\n- Reading space\n- Book Stack Rooms\n- Faculty–Student discussion room\n- Arrangement of adequate space for Reference section\n- Meeting Hall\n- Smart computer Lab\n- Archive space\nLibrary Rules and Regulations:\n- Library Opening Hours: 7:00AM - 8:00P.M. in weekdays and 12:00 P.M. - 6:00 P.M. on Saturday. The opening hour is subject to change as per needs and circumstances.\n- Books Circulation Hours: 9:00A.M. - 4:00 P.M. The circulation hour may be adjusted as per need and circumstances.\n- All bags, briefcases and personal belongings should be left outside the library.\n- Books as well as the personal files should be checked out from the checking counter.\n- Body search can be done for those who are suspected of malpractices in the library.\n- Books are borrowable for 30 days, and can be renewed once for the same period.\n- The member is expected to return borrowed books on or before the due date stamped on the date label in the book. An overdue charge will be levied for the late return of the book as follows: No overdue charge for first three days, and for rest of the days Rs. 3/- per vol. per day.\n- If the due date lies during holidays or vacation period, the book should be returned to the library on the opening day. Failure to return on the opening day is subject to overdue fines of the holidays/vacation period too. Books may be renewed if not required by other readers.\n- Journals, newspapers and reference materials are to be used only within the library.\n- The library books are for the benefit of not only the present but also the future members of the library. They should, therefore, be handled with every care and consideration.\n- Food, drink and smoking are not allowed in the library.\n- Identity Card is not transferable.\n- In case of loss or damage of the Identity Card, a duplicate card can be made with a fee of Rs. 150.00.\n- Identity Card should be returned to the library while obtaining library clearance.\n- Those who tear out the pages from any magazine or book will have to pay a fine and the fine will be decided by the Librarian.\n- The following are the penalties for doing malpractice in the library:\n- First Chance:\n- A fine of Rs. 1000.00 or the triple amount of the book which is going to be stolen; the higher is charged.\n- Notify the Director, Student’s Affairs, as well as in the Notice Board.\n- Inform the guardian.\n- Second Chance:\n- All of the penalties mentioned in (a).\n- Suspension of the membership period for the remaining semester or year.\n- Third Chance:\n- All of the penalties mentioned in (b).\n- Action to be taken for expulsion.\n- As the university library is a place of individual study and research, it is necessary to maintain an atmosphere of SILENCE and DIGNITY inside the library. Members are, therefore, reminded that conversation (direct or on mobile) or noisy consultation among themselves or demonstrative greetings inside the library is not permissible.\nServices:\nLibrary provides various services like:\n- Circulation\n- Inter-library loan\n- Reference and referral services\n- Reprographic services\n- User education\n- Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI)\n- Current Awareness Services (CAS)\n- Paper clippings\n- OPAC services\n- Internet and e-mail services\nOnline e-Resources\nBeing research-cum-teaching university, focus has been given to enrich the reference collection with less priority for text books which on the other hand the students themselves would be able to purchase. With this view, the library spent most of the budget in purchasing reference materials. Thus, the collection has proved to be a best collection in the respective field and is admired by faculty members and researchers within the campus, as well as the outsiders and visitors. The access to online e-resources received through Research4life further enriched the resources as well as the research activities in KU.\nInternet:\nWi-Fi hotspot available at Library Building inside for all to help them in their study, research and project work.\nLibrary Automation:\nLibrary automation means automating all the housekeeping operations of the library such as, acquisition, cataloguing, serials control, circulation, OPAC, etc. KU library previously used CDS/ISIS for information storage & retrieval. It was just a computerized catalogue. The technological development and the increasing demand of the users compelled us to think of the library automation, which resulted to install the Software for University Libraries (SOUL) developed by INFLIBNET Centre, an inter-university center of UGC of India, which made KU library the first academic library to have library automation in Nepalese context. Being more up-to-date, we have switched into the popular online library software KOHA (Open Source) which provides online access (search as well as status check) to our users from anywhere anytime. It also integrates KUCL with other KU libraries situated at different locations.\nOnline resources\nResearch4Life content is grouped into the following collections: (Please visit the Central Library for User and Password)\n- Hinari is one of the world's largest collections of biomedical and health literature.\n- AGORA is an outstanding digital library collection in the fields of food and agriculture.\n- Hinari is one of the world's largest collections of biomedical and health literature.\n- ARDI gives access to scientific and technical information.\n- GOALI focuses on law and social sciences, including politics, economics, philosophy, history and more.\n- OARE collects information resources on environment, including ecology, geography, energy and more.\n- JSTOR collects books, journals and articles on almost all faculties varies from Science to Culture and History\n- Bentham Science: http://eurekaselect.com", "comments": ""}

The KUCL has majority of books and journals specially related with School of Science and School of Engineering. It monitors services of all libraries of the university. Schools located in Kathmandu valley and Dhulikhel, have their own libraries to cater the information needs of the students and faculties.\nOther KU Libraries\n- Management Library, Balkumari (Lalitpur)\n- Arts and Education Library, Hattiban (Lalitpur)\n- Medical Sciences (KUMS) Library (Basic Sciences: Chaukot (Panauti) and Clinical Sciences: Dhulikhel Hospital)\n- KU Panchkhal Library (for Agriculture and AI), Panchkhal (Kavrepalanchowk).\n- Yogic Science Library, Chaukot (Panauti)\n- KUHS Library, Chaukot (Panauti)\nObjectives\n- To provide information for the fulfillment of the objectives of the university.\n- To provide information for teaching, research and management of the university.\n- To provide learning materials both in conventional and e-resources for study and research.\n- To adopt ICTs in housekeeping operations of the library.\n- To manage important documents in Archive mode\n- To be a full-fledged modern library (e-Library, Digital Library) and connect to all schools, extended & affiliated colleges.\nResource sharing between KU Central library systems to all schools, extended & affiliated colleges\nCollection of Information\nThe main focus is on professional areas like:\n- Sciences\n- Engineering\n- Management\n- Teacher-Education\n- Medical Sciences\n- Arts\n- Law\nKU Central Library has:\n- 60,000 Plus - Volumes of books\n- 2500 - CD-ROMs\n- 200 - Videocassettes\n- 125 - Journal titles and newsletters\n- 20 - Newspapers and Magazines\n- 75 - Audio cassettes\nInfrastructure:\nPeriodical section, technical processing section, Reference section, Stack-cum-reading room, Circulation section, Offices for librarian and assistant librarian, Store are all well designed. They are all equipped with necessary library furniture and equipment’s designed by the experts.\n- Reading space\n- Book Stack Rooms\n- Faculty–Student discussion room\n- Arrangement of adequate space for Reference section\n- Meeting Hall\n- Smart computer Lab\n- Archive space\nLibrary Rules and Regulations:\n- Library Opening Hours: 7:00AM - 8:00P.M. in weekdays and 12:00 P.M. - 6:00 P.M. on Saturday. The opening hour is subject to change as per needs and circumstances.\n- Books Circulation Hours: 9:00A.M. - 4:00 P.M. The circulation hour may be adjusted as per need and circumstances.\n- All bags, briefcases and personal belongings should be left outside the library.\n- Books as well as the personal files should be checked out from the checking counter.\n- Body search can be done for those who are suspected of malpractices in the library.\n- Books are borrowable for 30 days, and can be renewed once for the same period.\n- The member is expected to return borrowed books on or before the due date stamped on the date label in the book. An overdue charge will be levied for the late return of the book as follows: No overdue charge for first three days, and for rest of the days Rs. 3/- per vol. per day.\n- If the due date lies during holidays or vacation period, the book should be returned to the library on the opening day. Failure to return on the opening day is subject to overdue fines of the holidays/vacation period too. Books may be renewed if not required by other readers.\n- Journals, newspapers and reference materials are to be used only within the library.\n- The library books are for the benefit of not only the present but also the future members of the library. They should, therefore, be handled with every care and consideration.\n- Food, drink and smoking are not allowed in the library.\n- Identity Card is not transferable.\n- In case of loss or damage of the Identity Card, a duplicate card can be made with a fee of Rs. 150.00.\n- Identity Card should be returned to the library while obtaining library clearance.\n- Those who tear out the pages from any magazine or book will have to pay a fine and the fine will be decided by the Librarian.\n- The following are the penalties for doing malpractice in the library:\n- First Chance:\n- A fine of Rs. 1000.00 or the triple amount of the book which is going to be stolen; the higher is charged.\n- Notify the Director, Student’s Affairs, as well as in the Notice Board.\n- Inform the guardian.\n- Second Chance:\n- All of the penalties mentioned in (a).\n- Suspension of the membership period for the remaining semester or year.\n- Third Chance:\n- All of the penalties mentioned in (b).\n- Action to be taken for expulsion.\n- As the university library is a place of individual study and research, it is necessary to maintain an atmosphere of SILENCE and DIGNITY inside the library. Members are, therefore, reminded that conversation (direct or on mobile) or noisy consultation among themselves or demonstrative greetings inside the library is not permissible.\nServices:\nLibrary provides various services like:\n- Circulation\n- Inter-library loan\n- Reference and referral services\n- Reprographic services\n- User education\n- Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI)\n- Current Awareness Services (CAS)\n- Paper clippings\n- OPAC services\n- Internet and e-mail services\nOnline e-Resources\nBeing research-cum-teaching university, focus has been given to enrich the reference collection with less priority for text books which on the other hand the students themselves would be able to purchase. With this view, the library spent most of the budget in purchasing reference materials. Thus, the collection has proved to be a best collection in the respective field and is admired by faculty members and researchers within the campus, as well as the outsiders and visitors. The access to online e-resources received through Research4life further enriched the resources as well as the research activities in KU.\nInternet:\nWi-Fi hotspot available at Library Building inside for all to help them in their study, research and project work.\nLibrary Automation:\nLibrary automation means automating all the housekeeping operations of the library such as, acquisition, cataloguing, serials control, circulation, OPAC, etc. KU library previously used CDS/ISIS for information storage & retrieval. It was just a computerized catalogue. The technological development and the increasing demand of the users compelled us to think of the library automation, which resulted to install the Software for University Libraries (SOUL) developed by INFLIBNET Centre, an inter-university center of UGC of India, which made KU library the first academic library to have library automation in Nepalese context. Being more up-to-date, we have switched into the popular online library software KOHA (Open Source) which provides online access (search as well as status check) to our users from anywhere anytime. It also integrates KUCL with other KU libraries situated at different locations.\nOnline resources\nResearch4Life content is grouped into the following collections: (Please visit the Central Library for User and Password)\n- Hinari is one of the world's largest collections of biomedical and health literature.\n- AGORA is an outstanding digital library collection in the fields of food and agriculture.\n- Hinari is one of the world's largest collections of biomedical and health literature.\n- ARDI gives access to scientific and technical information.\n- GOALI focuses on law and social sciences, including politics, economics, philosophy, history and more.\n- OARE collects information resources on environment, including ecology, geography, energy and more.\n- JSTOR collects books, journals and articles on almost all faculties varies from Science to Culture and History\n- Bentham Science: http://eurekaselect.com", "comments": ""}
{"text": "Search programs...\nView all programsKathmandu University Central Campus, Dhulikhel premises has Guidance and Counseling Services under KU Guidance and Counseling Cell. We encourage the students to use the counseling opportunity and grow healthy, happy and productive.\nWhat is counseling and what is not?\nThe word counseling is in vogue nowadays. We hear people suggesting counseling for almost any kind of human enterprise and suffering. Many business companies, manpower agencies, technical institutions, educational organizations claim to be offering counseling. However, from the perspective of counseling and clinical psychology, whatever services these organizations are offering is information sharing but not the counseling. Hence, first of all we need to be clear what is not counseling before understanding what counseling is.\nWhat is not counseling\nWhat is counseling\nCounseling is dialogue between counselor and client. It is a special kind of dialogue because here counselor actively listens to clients' concerns, problems and suffering, nonjudgmentally, expressing empathy and fully accepting the client as he/she is in the present situation. At the same time counselor validates the client's emotion, behavior and thoughts. Listening, empathizing and validating are done in entirely confidential setting. In this safe and warm environment, client feels understood and validated. This very human connection prepares ground for change. This all does not happen overnight or in one or two sittings sometime it may take 5 or more sessions to build up a helping-relationship between counselor and client.\nAlongside the listening and empathizing, there is an assessment process going on. The assessment includes observing client's behavior, expressed emotion and thoughts, getting them to do certain test-scales and thorough history taking. The assessment procedure helps to determine the kinds of strategies to be executed for the client. Hence, for counseling to happen we need to keep these things in mind.\nMajor Counseling Strategies applied in KU Counseling Cell\n(The choice of strategy depends upon the kind of problems, severity, intensity indicated by assessment)\n1. Cognitive Strategy:\nIn this method, counselor conceptualizes client's problem resulted from thinking error and helps the client to think realistically through the process of cognitive restructuring. On the other hand, if the client's problems are not the result of erroneous cognition but are based on facts then the methods of systematic problem solving will be applied. This kind of help generally requires at least 12 sessions to realize a change.\n2. Behavioral Strategy:\nThis helping strategy conceptualizes client's problem to be the result of faulty learning. It means these problem behaviors are understood as classically conditioned, instrumentally conditioned or modeled. Then, the client is trained to unlearn the learned problematic behavior. The unlearning process follows exposure, contingency management and skill training etc. The cognitive and behavioral strategies often take place conjointly; hence, it is cognitive behavioral therapy. A client requires at least 10 to 12 sessions to realize change.\n3. Interpersonal Strategy:\nThis way of helping understands the client's problems to be the consequences of interpersonal deficit due to loss, conflict, alienation and role transition. Here, client is helped to correct deficit in any of these areas through the training in problems solving. The goal of the help is to make client skillful in interpersonal context. This helping modality requires client to complete 8 to 10 sessions to realize change.\n4. Relaxation Strategy:\nThis helping strategy conceptualizes the problem to be the failure of 'relax response'. Hence, to get relax, the client is trained in deep breathing, muscle relaxation, mindful awareness of breathing and body sensation and physical exercises. The relaxation exercise requires at least 6 to 8 sessions.\n5. Guidance:\nGuidance helps the client to choose academic discipline, career and jobs etc that better suits his/her interest and aptitude. In guidance as well student is helped to explore the possibilities from his/her own perspective rather than mere suggesting alternatives. However, in guidance counselor helps client to access to better resources and decide independently. Guidance requires a client to complete at least 3-5 sessions.\nWhat Counseling is for\nHow Counseling Cell reaches the students\nWhat are the services available?\nWhom to Contact\nMr. Madhav Khatiwada, Counselor and Lecturer, 9841725698, 9810043036\nGuidance and Counseling Cell- Block No. 10, Central Campus Dhulikhel", "comments": ""}

Having introduced futuristic pedagogies in engineering, medicine, science, management, humanities, education and law, KU is now poised to embrace the state-of-the-art technological, environmental and contemporary humanistic disciplines in its teaching-learning paradigms.\nThis transformation is now a global imperative, as the era of higher education, hitherto skewed towards loading young brains with information, knowledge and skills through teaching in classrooms, labs, and workshops, is nearing its end. For instance, adopting AI-enabled human-machine interfaces in teaching and learning has propelled a radical reorientation of wisdom over knowledge, future employability over current skills, and an undiminished trust in natural intelligence.\nIn this context, I call on you to collaborate in our new journey towards a smart, resilient and sustainable university. To this end, KU has started updating its curricula to be in tune with the changing global contexts, digitalising its academic services, and expanding its presence in all provinces of Nepal. Similarly, KU is undergoing a massive transformation in its academic governance and transparency by shortening the processes and reducing the paperwork while consolidating a system of accountability. In addition, through a meticulous reallocation of resources, KU is on its way to becoming a ‘green’ university in every sense of the term.\nKU aims to prepare its students to enter the competitive world of skills and jobs and, at the same time, continue to inculcate in them the zeal for social service, national development and respect for humanism. As the fourth Vice-Chancellor of KU, I invite you to join us in this mission of serving the future of humanity.
